#getconfig - config fetcher for node.js

Managing configs for different environments is kind of a pain.

In short I wanted it to:
- Organize configurations in different directories ('development', 'test', 'production', ..)
- Automatically merge with the configuration file in the root directory
- Use `NODE_ENV` environment variable to grab appropriate config
- let me just go `var config = require('getconfig')` from anywhere in the app and have it Just Workâ„¢
- Let me write configs that are structured like JSON but:
    - allow comments
    - single quotes
    - trailing commas

## How to use

1. `npm install getconfig`
2. Create a `app.json` file or `app.js` module
3. Just require getconfig like so from anywhere in your project:

```js
var config = require('getconfig');
var appConfig = config.get('test/config/app');
```
4. that's it!


## Where to put your config and what to call it
"testOverwrite"
Just place it so that it matches the following pattern: `{{ config }}.(json|js)` and `{{ env }}/{{ config }}.(json|js)`.

If `NODE_ENV` isn't set it defaults to `development`.

You can set name your environments whatever you want, but we color these nicely:

- `root` - app.json
- `root/development` - app.json
- `root/test` - app.json
- `root/production` - app.json


## Comments in JSON, oh my!

getconfig uses [ALCE](https://github.com/walmartlabs/ALCE) to parse JSON files, which means you can use comments, single quotes, and unquoted keys, woohoo! But of course it works just fine on regular JSON too. It just gives you the option.

## Options

getconfig will always fill in the `getconfig.env` value in your resulting config object with the current environment name so you can programatically determine the environment if you'd like.


## Changelog

0.5.0 - Now allowing to import config files as node modules <added in chaosmail/getconfig>

0.4.0 - Configurations now loaded from ENV directory <added in chaosmail/getconfig>

0.3.0 - Switching from JSON.parse to ALCE to allow single quotes and comments. Better readme.
